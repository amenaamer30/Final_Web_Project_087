     <h1>BLEND THE RULES</h1>
  <p>WE AREN’T YOUR AVERAGE BEAUTY BRAND.</p>
  <p>AND THAT’S JUST THE WAY WE LIKE IT.</p>
  <p>WHY FIT IN WHEN WE WERE BORN TO STAND OUT?</p>

  <p className="paragraphs">Morphe was born in 2008 among the artists and influencers in Los Angeles. Finally. A beauty brand created for the creators. For the dreamers. For those looking for killer makeup without killing their wallet. A place where our #MorpheBabe can let their passion and creativity for beauty fly high. We’re more than just a brand; we’re a ride-or-die fam.</p>

  <p className="paragraphs">Our bold, badass roots started with professional-yet-affordable brushes but didn’t stop there. Color was calling. So, we answered with eyeshadow palettes, lip colors, and more.</p>

  <p className="paragraphs">At Morphe, there are no rules. Stereotypes? Not interested. We’re real all the way. Dare to create. Push those boundaries. Make an impact. Show the world your true, vivid, exploding colors.</p>

  <p className="paragraphs">You do you. And no one else. Blend the rules, Morphe Babe.
